         Exercise 1. Geometrical shapes class hierarchy
        Using inheritance, design the class hierarchy for the following classses: Shape, Circle, Rectangle, Square. 
        
        Exercise 2. Access modifiers
        Make sure that the base class(es) have private/protected/public methods and data members, and check if they are accessible in the inheriting classes. 
        
        Exercise 3. Constructors
        Define constructors for all the classes in Exercise 1, each of the constructors writes to the console the name of the class. 
        In every constructor of an inheriting class, call the constructor of the base class too; check the output when creating objects of each 
        class to figure out the order in which the constructors (the class's constructor and the base constructor) are called. 
        
        Exercise 4. Student with courses
        Define the classes Student and Course, to that each Student has multiple Courses, and each Course has multiple grades.
        Implement the methods in class Student for setting/getting a student's grades at various courses (e.g. Math, Programming, English)
        Note: you don't need inheritance for this!
        
        Exercise 5. Desing a Library cladd model
        Try to define the class model for a Library (for borrowing books, not a store!). 
        The purpose is to identify the relevant classes, their data members and methods, and how they should interact. 
        Note: this exercise does not have a single correct approach; think about what functionalities you want to implement and implement them however you want.
        Some ideas: Person.Borrow(Book), Person.Return(Book), Library.Register(Person), etc.
        
        Exercise 6. ChickMagnet
        On the SuperRacingCar class presented at the course, implement the "chick magnet" functionality. */
