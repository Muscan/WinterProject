        Exercise 1. 
        Using any class implemented in the previous homeworks, split it into multiple files by using partial classes. 
        
        Exercise 2. 
        Add an extension method to the class from Exercise 1. 
        Add an extension method named SubstractTen to the int data type. Implement this method so that it substracts 10 from a number and returns the result. You should be able to call it like this: 7.SubstractTen() (the result is -1) or i.SubstractTen(), where i is a variable of type int and the result is i - 10. 
        
        Exercise 3. 
        Create an enum which contains the months of a year. 
        
        Exercise 4. 
        Create a desktop application. Add a button to the form, and implement the button's click event handler so that when the button is clicked, the application will display a message window. 
        Add a textbox control to the window, and when clicking the button display the message from the textbox in the message box. 
        Add a combobox (dropdown) control to the window and populate it either statically (from the designer) or dynamically (in the code, from a list, in the form's constructor, after the method InitializeComponent() is called)
        Add labels for each of the controls in the window. 
        Arrange all controls so that they are all aligned to each other and have the same size. 
        Rename the controls so that instead of the default names they have meaningful names. 
        
        Exercise 5. 
        Play with a desktop application by putting any controls you want on the form and try to see how they work. 
        Suggestions: datetimepicker, checkbox/checkboxlist, openfiledialog, groupbox, picturebox, tooltip, etc. */
